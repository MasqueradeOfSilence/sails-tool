INFO: For this initial commit, I'm just going to submit a PR for this file. Then, I will try a simple cube. 

Let's see how it goes.

HELPFUL TIPS:
- If Vim freezes, use Ctrl+Q to unfreeze it. You'll find that all of your keystrokes have been recorded.

NOTES TO SELF:
- I will be working on a) the sails, b) flip fluids, and c) the explosion. 
- I need to submit progress each class period, starting with next Wednesday (but try and do it by Friday). 
- "Animatic" and "cut" are interchangeable terms. 
- Ideally, we will be able to export our Houdini project as a text file.
